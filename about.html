  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <p><strong>Dirt Bikes USA</strong> was founded in 1996 by two passionate riders, Carl Schmidt and Steven McFadden, in Carbondale, Colorado. What began as a vision to build better-performing, customizable dirt bikes quickly grew into a high-powered brand known nationwide for racing and off-road adventure.</p>
  <p>We design our own frames and integrate top-tier parts from trusted brands like Rotax and Dunlop. Our bikes — the Enduro 250 & 550 and Moto 300 & 450 — are built for serious riders who value speed, agility, and quality engineering.</p>
  <p>With over 120 employees and a family-like atmosphere, we lead with innovation and live to ride. Whether you're tearing up a trail or dominating a dirt track, we’ve got a bike that’s built for you.</p>
